                <h3>Data Science.</h3>
                <p>I love Data Science and Data Science loves me back! I studied Statistics, Machine Learning, Big Data and more at University and enjoy using these skills on practice.
                    I cannot wait to learn more of it, so I also study by my own using online tools such as Coursera and
                    Udemy.</p>

                <h3>Coding.</h3>
                <p>I code in Python and JavaScript. Nowadays I try to spend as much time coding as I can, 
                    either for leisure, completing personal projects, or studying.</p>

                <h3>Natural Sciences.</h3>
                <p>Before pivoting to my BSc at Bocconi, I was actually into science! I won several national Chemistry
                    Olympiads and even had a gold medal on the International Mendeleev Chemistry Olympiad, 
                    and I also know one or two things about Physics.
                    So if you are looking for a person who also has natural science knowledge, maybe I am the one you are looking for!
