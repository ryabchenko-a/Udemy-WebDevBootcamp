The idea behind Simon Game is to remember and replicate the growing pattern of buttons. You can find the official game rules [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/simon/game-rules.php).

To start the game, press any key (do not press on buttons yet!). 
After you started the game, Simon will light a button for you, replicate it after Simon.
Each time Simon choose a new button, you will need to replicate the entire sequence, that is all the buttons Simon has ever pressed, in the correct order.
If you press the wrong button, the game is over, and you can restarted by pressing any key.
